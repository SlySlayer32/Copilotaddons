### Custom chat modes generation for software development

    The idea is to create a set of predefined chat modes following "https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/chatmodes" guidelines that cater to each step of development. Each mode will have its own set of instructions and guidelines and tools for the agent to follow. these chat modes will be tailored to the specific needs of each section of development, ensuring that the agent can provide relevant and accurate assistance. 
    
    The file structure to follow the original is "chatmods/planner/implementation-plan.chatmode.md" as a reference for creating new chat modes.

    Tailor each chatmode to the specific needs of the development process. Reference "project.md" for more details on the project setup and configuration. this will ensure that the agent can provide relevant and accurate assistance throughout the development lifecycle.
  
    Each mode should follow the structure and format of [text](chatmodes/planner/implementation-plan.chatmode.md) think how to make them more effective and specifically tailored to the project requirements described in "project.md":

The following are the proposed chat modes for front end development and i will create similar ones for backend development later.

its crucial that each chatmode is designed to address the unique challenges and requirements of its respective phase in the development process. it must have clear objectives, guidelines, and tools to ensure that the AI agent can effectively assist in that specific area of development. aspecially the TTD and Debug modes need to be very precise in their instructions to ensure high code quality and effective problem-solving.
