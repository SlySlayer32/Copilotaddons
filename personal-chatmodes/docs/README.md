## 🎯 Key Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **RED**: Write tests first (they fail)
- **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass tests
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Mobile-First
- React Native 0.81.4 + Expo SDK 54
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Gluestack UI + NativeWind
- TanStack Query + Zustand
- Supabase backend
- Jest + Detox testing

### Quality Standards
- ✅ 60 FPS performance
- ✅ Works on iOS 13.0+ and Android API 21+
- ✅ Full offline support
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Production-ready security

## 📖 Documentation Structure

### Chatmodes

Each chatmode file includes:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter (description, tools)
- ✅ Primary directive
- ✅ Core identity
- ✅ Input/output format with examples
- ✅ Detailed process steps
- ✅ Project context (React Native/Expo specifics)
- ✅ Mobile development standards
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Next steps

### Guides

- **Founder Guide**: Non-technical language, examples, troubleshooting
- **Validation Test**: Technical validation checklist, expected outputs

## 🛠 Tech Stack Coverage

### Core Technologies
- React Native 0.81.4
- Expo SDK 54
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Expo Router (file-based routing)

### UI & Styling
- Gluestack UI (component library)
- NativeWind (Tailwind for RN)

### State & Data
- TanStack Query (server state)
