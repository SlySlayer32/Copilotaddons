```

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names: `python-testing-assistant.md`
- Include the domain/language in the name when applicable
- Avoid generic names like `chatmode1.md`

### File Location

- **Examples**: `chatmodes/examples/` - Demonstrative examples
- **Community**: `chatmodes/community/` - General contributions
- **Templates**: `chatmodes/templates/` - Reusable templates

### Content Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable instructions
2. **Include References**: Link to official documentation and resources
3. **Add Examples**: Show concrete examples of desired behavior
4. **Stay Focused**: Keep each chatmode focused on a specific domain
5. **Update Regularly**: Ensure references and best practices are current

## Improvement Guidelines

When improving chatmode files, focus on:

### Code Development Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Add linting rules, formatting guidelines
- **Architecture**: Include design pattern references
- **Testing**: Add testing strategies and frameworks
- **Documentation**: Reference documentation standards
- **Security**: Incorporate OWASP guidelines and security checks
- **Performance**: Add optimization techniques

### Documentation References
